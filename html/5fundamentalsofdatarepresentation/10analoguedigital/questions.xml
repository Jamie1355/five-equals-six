<question>
	<text>
		Explain the fundamental difference between analogue and digital signals.
	</text>
	<answer>
		Analogue signals are continuous and can take any number of values, digital signals are discrete and can only take preset values.
	</answer>

<question>
	<text>
		Describe the way an ADC (analogue to digital converter) works.
	</text>
	<answer>
		The continuous signal is sampled at a certain frequency, and each sample is recorded as binary data.
	</answer>
</question>

<question>
	<text>
		Describe the way a DAC (digital to analogue converter) works.
	</text>
	<answer>
		The digital data represents the value of the analogue signal, so a voltage is produced equal to this value for each sample. Interpolation may be used to 
		smooth the discrete intervals, depending on the purpose of the DAC.
	</answer>

<question>
	<text>
		Describe why digital data is far more resistant to noise than analogue data.
	</text>
	<answer>
		Values received that have been modified by noise can be restored to their true values as they can only be 1 or 0; anything in between is impossible. Analogue
		signals are allowed to be anything, so any such restoration is impossible.
